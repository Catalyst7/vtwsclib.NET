## Licensing

## Dependencies

### [JSON.NET](http://json.codeplex.com/)

The JavaScriptSerializer class was not introduced until .NET 3.5, so in order to provide backwards compatibility to .NET 2.0, JToken.ToString is utilized instead.

### [vtiger CRM Webservice Client Library](http://forge.vtiger.com/projects/vtwsclib)

Though based on the PHP vtwsclib, this library does not currently implement all of its methods.
